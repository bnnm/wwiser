# PROPERTY CALCULATIONS
#
# Wwise objects have associated "properties" (volumes, delays, pitch, etc), but the way final
# values are calculated is rather complex. Objects are part of a hierarchy (parents) and
# properties "trickle down" differently depending on their type:
# - "relative" properties (volume, pitch, lfo, etc): final value adds from all parents
# - "absolute" properties (bus, positioning, etc): first value found (current object may overwrite parent)
# - "behavior" properties (loops, delays, etc): only used when event chain passes over those objects
# (not an official classification)
#
# "Relative" and "absolute" properties are taken from current and parent objects, even if an event chain
# doesn't 'use' said parents, while "behavior" properties's meaning are usually object-dependant 
# (doesn't make sense to inherit a loop flag).
#
# For example with a "family" of aksound >> switch >> actor-mixer the aksound inherits properties from
# both ancestors (even if actor-mixers aren't part of events). This way one can make hierarchies and change
# multiple children's properties at once (setting the actor-mixer's volume).
#
# If some part of the family has properties that change via statechunk/rtpc, and are active, they are
# taken into account when calculating object's properties. Each only allows changing some types of
# properties though.
#
#
# BUSES
# Apart from their inheritance, "audible" (.wem) objects 'pass through' an assigned "bus" ("absolute" prop).
# Buses in turn have and inherit properties that are then applied to the object. These props are
# separate so you can route an object through buses with distinct effects and config without having to
# change the object directly. Buses can't have "behavior" properties (to create a "delay" prop would
# need to use "effects").
#
# Multiple objects may override bus, but only first defined one is used and rest would be ignored.
# - ranseq [master-bus] > aksound [(no bus)] 
# - ranseq [master-bus] > aksound [music-bus]
# In the first case, aksound uses master-bus's props, but in the second only music-bus is used.
# (if master-bus has -96db, aksound will be silent in the first case, not in the second).
#
# Objects may set special bus props (OutputBusVolume/HPF/HPF) which only apply to the *directly* overriden bus.
#   > ranseq   OutpuBusVolume = -5db        OverrideID=music-bus
#     > segment   OutpuBusVolume = -10db        OverrideID=master-bus
# In the example only -10db is applied (not -15db). If segment removes OverrideBusId it would use -5db
# by inheriting bus + applying parent's props, but OutputBusVolume may still be defined in segment
# (the Wwise editor internally hides -10db if override is unset, shows -10db again if set).
# OutputBusVolume set via RTPC or states also matter.
# Note that buses also have OutputBusVolume which is inherited from parents and applied normally.
#
# Generally bus volumes aren't too important since final volume can be autonormalized, but in
# odd cases buses are used to fix certain .wem volumes and may contain useful statechunks
# (seen in Astral Chain wems with  "low" "mid" buses + silence states).
#
#
# EXAMPLE
# - object hierarchy                                     - bus hierarchy
#   actormixer {vol +2db} [bus=master_bus]                 bgm_bus { vol +1db }
#       > statechunk: bgm=hi > vol = +3db                    master_bus { vol -3db }
#     ranseq {delay +2} [bus=sound_bus]                    sound_bus { vol +2db }
#       switch {vol 0db, delay +1} [bus=bgm_bus]
#         aksound {vol -1db} [bus=0]
#
# - with an event > actionplay > aksound, calculations are:
#   * aksound's family props: { vol -1+0+0+2 = +1db }
#     > ranseq's delay is an "absolute" prop = not inherited
#   * aksound's bus=0 > inherit ancestor's first valid bus: bgm_bus
#   * bus_output's family props: { vol +1-3 = -2db }
#   * aksound final props: { vol +1-2db = -1db }
#   * if we set state bgm=hi, also inherits +3db from the actormixer
#
# - with an event > actionplay > ranseq
#   * ranseq: apply delay 2
#     > non-audio objects don't pass over busses, so sound_bus's vol isn't used
#   * switch: apply delay 1
#     > bgm_bus props also don't apply
#   * aksound: calc final props like before
#     > by following this path, aksound has delay 2+1 (plus its own delay if any is set)
#
# Resulting properties are clamped to valid min/max, depending on type.
# Some properties have special meanings and are applied at different points (for example
# there are "Volume", "MakeUpGain", "OutputBusVolume", "BusVolume", etc) but ultimately
# are added the final value (in simpler cases, see below).
#
#
# BUS TYPES
# Buses actually come in two forms:
# - non-mixing: properties are passed down to the objects
# - mixing: does processing then applies (some) properties
#   - BusVolume/OutputBusVolume are post applied, Volume/MakeUpGain are still passed down
# A bus becomes "mixing" when does anything that would alter the audio buffers: aux/hdr bus, has effects (even
# if bypassed), has positioning, changes channels (down/upmixing), RTPC on BusVolume/OutputBusVolume/LPF/HPF, etc.
# Buses on top (master) are also mixing, since they make final output.
#
# Basically Wwise tries to pass "voices" (individual .wem buffers) around and applying props at once and mixing as
# late as possible, then creating a "main mix" or final N.Nch buffer, before # sending to the endpoint (platform's
# audio out). But if a bus modifies audio signal, can't add certain props or meaning changes:
# - doing -2db, then -2db == doing -4db once (so it's faster done once)
# - doing -2db, eq+reverb, -2db != doing -4db, eq+reverb
#
# Example:
#   123.wem: +1db VoiceVolume
#       stage_bus: { +2db BusVolume, +3 OutputBusVolume }               (non-mixing)
#           bgm_bus: {effect=reverb, +4db VoiceVolume, +5db BusVolume}  (mixing due to effect)
#              main_bus: { +6db VoiceVolume, +7db BusVolume}             (non-mixing)
#                  master_bus: {+8db BusVolume}                         (mixing due to master)
#   * apply voice volumes: 1+4+6=11 and 2+3 (*any* VoiceVolumes in chain, and bus props until next mixing bus)
#   * apply effect + bus volumes: 5 and 7 (bus props until next mixing bus)
#   * apply bus volumes: 8 + final output (N.N audio), total 36db
#
# Latest Wwise versions also separate mixing buses into 3 subtypes depending on if the bus mixes voices or applies
# effects over individual wem, though some effects are ignored ("peak limiter" is unrealiable per wem or reverb
# would be slow).
#
# The calculations below treat all buses as non-mixing (adds all props once), since we can't apply effects, though
# results should be reasonably close.


# relative props are only added when node is an actual sound output object
